# Adult Income Classification: Five-Model Comparison

## 1. Project Overview

This project uses the **UCI Adult Census Income dataset** to predict whether a person's annual income is greater than `$50K`.

It trains and compares five classification algorithms using the same training/test split and preprocessing pipeline. The trained preprocessing-plus-model pipelines are saved as Joblib files and can be evaluated through a Streamlit application.

- **Target column:** `income`
- **Positive class:** `>50K` (encoded as `1`)
- **Negative class:** `<=50K` (encoded as `0`)
- **Input features:** 14
- **Models:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine

The Streamlit application loads the saved models and evaluates them on a labelled CSV file. **The application does not train or retrain models.**

## 2. Dataset

**Dataset:** Adult (Census Income)  
**Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository – Adult](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult)

The repository uses the official UCI training and test files:

| File | Rows |
|---|---:|
| `data/adult.data` | 32,561 |
| `data/adult.test` | 16,281 |
| **Total** | **48,842** |

The dataset contains 14 predictor features and one target column (`income`).

### Feature columns

**Numerical features (6):**
- `age`
- `fnlwgt`
- `education_num`
- `capital_gain`
- `capital_loss`
- `hours_per_week`

**Categorical features (8):**
- `workclass`
- `education`
- `marital_status`
- `occupation`
- `relationship`
- `race`
- `sex`
- `native_country`

### Data preparation

The notebook applies the following preparation steps:

1. Loads the official training and test files using the original column names.
2. Strips leading and trailing whitespace from categorical values and target labels.
3. Replaces categorical `?` placeholders with `Unknown`.
4. Removes the trailing period from test-set labels such as `>50K.`.
5. Encodes `>50K` as `1` and `<=50K` as `0`.
6. Standardizes numerical features using `StandardScaler`.
7. One-hot encodes categorical features using `OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown="ignore", sparse_output=False)`.
8. Uses a `ColumnTransformer` inside each scikit-learn `Pipeline`.

The preprocessing steps are fitted on the training data only. The held-out test data is used for evaluation, not model fitting.

## 3. Models

All five models use the same training split and preprocessing approach.

| Model | Classifier configuration |
|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | `LogisticRegression(max_iter=2000)` |
| Decision Tree | `DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)` |
| KNN | `KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)` |
| Naive Bayes | `GaussianNB()` |
| SVM | `LinearSVC(C=1.0, max_iter=3000, random_state=42)` |

Each saved `.joblib` file contains the complete fitted pipeline, including preprocessing and the classifier.

## 4. Evaluation Metrics

The models are evaluated using six metrics:

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| Accuracy | Proportion of all predictions that are correct |
| AUC | Area under the ROC curve, calculated from positive-class scores |
| Precision | Proportion of predicted positive cases that are actually positive |
| Recall | Proportion of actual positive cases correctly identified |
| F1 | Harmonic mean of precision and recall |
| MCC | Matthews Correlation Coefficient, a balanced measure of binary classification quality |

For models that support `predict_proba()`, AUC uses the predicted probability for the positive class. For `LinearSVC`, which does not provide `predict_proba()`, AUC uses `decision_function()` scores.

### Results on the official test split

The following values are recorded in the executed notebook. Values are rounded to four decimal places.

| Model | Accuracy | AUC | Precision | Recall | F1 | MCC |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Logistic Regression | 0.8530 | 0.9055 | 0.7306 | 0.5985 | 0.6580 | 0.5701 |
| Decision Tree | 0.8082 | 0.7405 | 0.5909 | 0.6121 | 0.6013 | 0.4752 |
| KNN | 0.8332 | 0.8579 | 0.6622 | 0.5998 | 0.6295 | 0.5232 |
| Naive Bayes | 0.5532 | 0.7639 | 0.3389 | 0.9376 | 0.4979 | 0.3320 |
| SVM (LinearSVC) | 0.8540 | 0.9048 | 0.7387 | 0.5910 | 0.6567 | 0.5711 |

### Observations

- **SVM (LinearSVC)** has the highest accuracy, precision, and MCC in this recorded evaluation.
- **Logistic Regression** has the highest AUC and F1 score.
- **Naive Bayes** has the highest recall, but its precision and accuracy are substantially lower, indicating many false-positive predictions.
- The majority-class baseline accuracy on the test split is approximately `0.7638`. Accuracy should therefore be considered alongside AUC, precision, recall, F1, and MCC.

These results describe this particular held-out test split; they do not guarantee the same performance on other data.

### Main files and folders

- `ML_Assignment_2.ipynb` — data preparation, model training, evaluation, model export, and saved-model verification.
- `app.py` — Streamlit application for evaluating the saved models on labelled CSV data.
- `requirements.txt` — Python package dependencies.
- `data/` — original UCI Adult training and test data files.
- `model/` — five saved fitted pipelines.
- `test_data.csv` — exported labelled test data used by the application and available as a sample download.

The notebook contains its own configuration, constants, and helper functions. A separate `common.py` file is not required by the current project.

## 6. Setup

Use Python in a virtual environment if possible.

### Windows PowerShell

Open a terminal in the repository root:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\91949\MLAssignment
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Install the dependencies:

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If PowerShell blocks activation, you can install and run the project using the `python` executable without activating the environment.

## 7. Run the Notebook and Generate Model Files

The repository includes the five saved model files and `test_data.csv`. If you need to recreate them:

1. Confirm that `data/adult.data` and `data/adult.test` are present.
2. Open `ML_Assignment_2.ipynb` from the repository root.
3. Run the notebook cells in order.
4. Run the model export section.

The export section creates the `model/` directory if needed, saves the five fitted pipelines with `joblib.dump()`, and exports the labelled test data to `test_data.csv`.

The notebook then reloads the saved pipelines and checks that their evaluation metrics match the in-memory model results.

Expected model files:

```text
model/logistic_regression.joblib
model/decision_tree.joblib
model/knn.joblib
model/naive_bayes.joblib
model/svm.joblib
```

## 8. Run the Streamlit Application

From the repository root, run:

```powershell
streamlit run app.py
```

Streamlit will print a local URL in the terminal, usually:

```text
http://localhost:8501
```

Open that URL in your browser.

### Application workflow

1. Choose the bundled `test_data.csv` or upload another CSV.
2. The application checks that all 14 feature columns and the `income` target column are present.
3. The target labels are validated and normalized.
4. The application separates the predictors (`X`) and true labels (`y`).
5. Select one of the five saved models, or choose **All models** for a comparison.
6. The selected fitted pipeline is loaded from the `model/` directory using `joblib.load()`.
7. Predictions and positive-class scores are generated.
8. The application calculates Accuracy, AUC, Precision, Recall, F1, and MCC.
9. For an individual model, the application displays six metric values, a confusion matrix with counts and row percentages, and a classification report.
10. For **All models**, the application displays a six-metric comparison table.

### CSV format required by the application

An uploaded CSV must include these 15 columns:

```text
age
fnlwgt
education_num
capital_gain
capital_loss
hours_per_week
workclass
education
marital_status
occupation
relationship
race
sex
native_country
income
```

- Numerical columns must contain numeric values.
- Categorical columns should contain text values.
- The target column must contain `<=50K` or `>50K`. A trailing period, as in `>50K.`, is accepted.
- Categorical `?` values are converted to `Unknown`.
- Extra columns are ignored.
- The uploaded CSV must include the true target labels because the application calculates evaluation metrics; this is not an unlabeled prediction-only workflow.

### No retraining in the application

The Streamlit application only loads the already trained `.joblib` pipelines and evaluates them. It does not call `fit()` and does not retrain or update any saved model. Uploaded data is used for evaluation only.

## 9. Requirements

The project dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them with:

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The application and notebook use Python libraries including Streamlit, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Joblib, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## 10. Troubleshooting

**`FileNotFoundError` for a model**

- Confirm that the five `.joblib` files exist in the `model/` directory.
- Run the notebook's model export section if the files are missing.
- Start Streamlit from the repository root.

**`test_data.csv` not found**

- Confirm that `test_data.csv` is beside `app.py`.
- Run the notebook's final export section to recreate it.

**Missing required columns**

- Check the uploaded CSV header against the 15 required column names listed above.
- Ensure the target column is named `income`.

**Invalid numeric values**

- Check the six numerical columns for text values or blank cells.

**Package or version errors**

- Activate the intended Python environment.
- Reinstall dependencies using `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
